Functions: Mad Lib

Creating Functions
	• New functions work just like the ones in standard language
		○ Go off and perform a task, return control back to program
	• Advantage of writing new functions
		○ Break code up into manageable pieces


Declaring Functions
	• Function prototype
		○ Code that describes a function
	• Parameters
		○ Receive the values sent as arguments in a function call
	• 'void' return type
		○ Does not need to 'return' specific value
		○ Others may need to return 'string' or 'int', or more


Defining Functions
	• Function header
		○ Return value of function (or void), name of function, list of parameters between parentheses
	• Function body
		○ Everything that lies within the curly brackets {}


Understanding Abstraction
	• Abstraction
		○ Act of writing and calling functions
		○ Lets you think about big picture without worrying about details
		○ Similar to slang, or coworkers using keywords


Understanding Encapsulation
	• Encapsulation
		○ No variable defined in a function can be used outside of that function


	• Scope
		○ Determines where the variable can be seen in your program
		○ Allow you to limit accessibility of variables
		○ Key to encapsulation


Inlining Functions
	• Ask the compiler to make a copy of the function everywhere it's called
		○ Program control doesn't have to jump to different location each time function is called
